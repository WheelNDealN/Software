                ----Overview----
This application is an inventory management project.
an example use of this is if a employee wants a new piece of hardware they must login, and create a new request.

                ----How to create a user/navigate----
the login is fairly straight forward and create a user creates a user.
for the two factor authentification you must create a user then add the secret code to the google app on your Phone
and type in the time limited code that pops up this will sign you in.
to modify or change anything it all runs of the id you provide, its next to whatever you need to change, simply type the number and press an assosiated button that you want to complete.

                ----Admin acocunt----
An admin account can be made by using the password "pa$$word", this isnt how it should be done in a real application, however for ease of testing for the marker its a simple specific password
i am able to make anyone an admin through the database, however to be able to set up 2fa the admin needs to be created to recieve the 2fa code for the app.

                ----IMPORTANT----
PRESS BUTTONS RATHER THAN PRESSING ENTER ON THE KEYBOARD
after testing with a friend i learned if you press enter to natvigate, it presses the first button available, which isnt always the option you want
to mitigate this please just press buttons you want to use
